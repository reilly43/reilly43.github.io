  Google Season of Docs came to me at the perfect time in my career. I just started in the technical writing field 8 months ago. This was the career I was always meant to pursue but never knew existed! This program allows me to work on other projects—completely different from what I work on in my day job. My first task was to create an explainer video discussing how the internet works. What a concept. To be honest, I am not fully versed in the subject but this was the challenge I was looking for.
  </p>
      <h2>The tools</h2>
<p>
  In the past, I worked with video creation tools such as Camtasia and Articulate; however, I do not have liscenses for these on my personal computer. It is always a challenge to work with limited resources and create something professional. I decided to work with what I had. Microsoft Powerpoint works surprisingly well for creating these type of videos. I created vector illustrations using the drawing tools native to Powerpoint. I recorded all audio in Audacity and applied noise reduction effects to get the best sounding voiceover. I worked with advanced animations and matched the animations' timing to my voiceover by setting triggers in Powerpoint. From there, I was able to add transitions and rehearse timings. The video came together really well and I am really satisfied with the final product. I found a method that worked really well for creating animation triggers based on the voiceover, so I am sharing that in the video below.

<!-- <p>This document outlines options to create a safe alternate route for trail traffic while the Olentangy Trail
is closed under the 315/270 interchange.</p>

<p>The routes proposed will not only serve to keep bike traffic flowing safely during this
construction but will create new connections between neighborhoods and the Olentangy Trail, providing
valuable service well beyond the scope of the 315/270 project.</p> -->

<h2 id="route-options">Be a Life Long Student</h2>

<p>
  When I first started working out I would try new variations and constantly learn new techniques. I was a beginner, I didn’t know what was right from wrong so I had to keep on experimenting and testing out new techniques that felt right. I would research new variations of exercises and then test them out, the gym was my lab. If the exercise felt good then I would continue doing it.  However, once I thought I found the perfect exercise then the learning stopped and the habit started.   I got into the habit of doing the same exercises but not really going up in weight. I was hitting a plateau and did not know how to take my training to the next level. The problem that I realized was that I was not aware that was plateauing and not improving in my workouts. The one thing that I started doing was recording my workouts and my weight. I want to see overtime how well I am doing but more importantly find the contextual relationship between my improvements and the actions I take to achieve them. It is almost as if I am running an experiment and testing out new exercises seeing which ones yield the greatest result.
</p>
<p>
  I have to be able to let myself learn again and constantly improve. Sometimes it takes an outsider to point out what can be improved. A set of fresh eyes can easily point out something that has gone undetected to you. We can do this ourselves by learning how to reflect in a non-judgmental way in areas that we can improve in. The smartest people are lifelong students. I loved it in college where I can explore deeply a topic and discover all of its intricacies. I learned how to give myself the freedom to learn and just learn for the sake of it.  I think of being a student as constantly growing and the freedom to explore. When we stop learning and stop trying to seek out new possibilities we are caged up and our growth is stunted. We impose artificial barriers that prevent us from becoming a student and trying new things. Whether it is being afraid to look foolish or being scared of the unknown these limitations we impose upon ourselves hinder our growth. We then hesitate to try something new in a different way and this paralyzes us.
</p>
<h2 id="route-options">The Never Ending Peak</h2>

<p>
  All it takes is just one small tweak and you can potentially see 5 times the improvement. Always keep on learning and keep trying new things, don’t get stuck in a rut, which is the joy of exploring life. Now, can we even reach the peak, is there even a peak? It might seem foolish to keep chasing a goal that just keeps on growing infinitely. We can have two takes on this: one is to never be satisfied and always yearn for more and the second is be happy with where you are at now and have fun experimenting and improving yourself. Instead of treating it as work you want to treat it as play and adventure, always seeking the infinite possibility.
