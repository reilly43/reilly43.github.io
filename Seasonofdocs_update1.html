<p>
  Google Season of Docs came to me at the perfect time in my career. I just started a technical writing position less than a year ago and I feel like I have a lot to learn. This is my second career after spending 6 years in higher education. Luckily, the transition was not too difficult and I have found a lot of similarities between both fields. This was the career I was always meant to pursue but never knew existed! This program allows me to work on other projectsâ€”completely different from what I work on in my day job. My first task was to create an explainer video discussing how the internet works. What a concept. To be honest, I am not fully versed in the subject but this was the challenge I was looking for.
  </p>
      <h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>
  In the past, I worked with video creation tools such as Camtasia and Articulate; however, I do not have licenses for these tools or anything similar on my personal computer. It is always a challenge to work with limited resources and create something professional. I decided to work with what I had. Microsoft PowerPoint is surprisingly well-suited for creating this type of video.
  </p>
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>I created vector illustrations using the drawing tools native to PowerPoint. I recorded all of the audio in Audacity and applied noise reduction effects to get the best sounding voiceover. I worked with advanced animation functions in PowerPoint and matched the animations' timing to my voiceover by setting triggers in PowerPoint. From there, I was able to add transitions and rehearse timings. The video came together really well and I am really satisfied with the final product. I found a method that worked really well for creating animation triggers based on the voiceover, so I am sharing a tutorial as well as some of my observations in the video below.

      <p>Until next time, happy writing!</p>
