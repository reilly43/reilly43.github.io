<p>
  Google Season of Docs came to me at the perfect time in my career. I just started a technical writing position less than a year ago and I feel like I have a lot to learn. This is my second career after spending 6 years in higher education. Luckily, the transition was not too difficult and I have found a lot of similarities between both fields. This was the career I was always meant to pursue but never knew existed! This program allows me to work on other projectsâ€”completely different from what I work on in my day job. My first task was to create an explainer video discussing how the internet works. What a concept. To be honest, I am not fully versed in the subject but this was the challenge I was looking for.
  </p>
      <h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>
  In the past, I worked with video creation tools such as Camtasia and Articulate; however, I do not have licenses for these tools or anything similar on my personal computer. It is always a challenge to work with limited resources and create something professional. I decided to work with what I had. Microsoft PowerPoint is surprisingly well-suited for creating this type of video. 
  </p>
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>I created vector illustrations using the drawing tools native to PowerPoint. I recorded all of the audio in Audacity and applied noise reduction effects to get the best sounding voiceover. I worked with advanced animation functions in PowerPoint and matched the animations' timing to my voiceover by setting triggers in PowerPoint. From there, I was able to add transitions and rehearse timings. The video came together really well and I am really satisfied with the final product. I found a method that worked really well for creating animation triggers based on the voiceover, so I am sharing a tutorial as well as some of my observations in the video below.

      <p>Until next time, happy writing!</p>

is closed under the 315/270 interchange.</p>

<p>The routes proposed will not only serve to keep bike traffic flowing safely during this
construction but will create new connections between neighborhoods and the Olentangy Trail, providing
valuable service well beyond the scope of the 315/270 project.</p> -->

        <p>I wanted a straightforward, client-side solution for downloading the SVG charts generated by Highcharts as images. It can be done, but relies on a set of web technologies that are still evolving.</p>
